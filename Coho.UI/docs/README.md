# Coho.UI Readme

Coho.UI is the Open source version the UI stack that was used in PageFabric application.  
I am porting all visual components to this library to help you create rich and immersive UI using the Sun Valley design used in Microsoft products.  


You can get the code and the documentation at https://github.com/sebbouez/Coho.UI  
Sample application is available in the repo.

You can of course contribute to the project.
